## Challenges we ran into

- Challenges we ran into
Tensorflow Lite has scarce resources online and it was major challenge to build a model that is fast for mobile applications. Integrating a model on React and Dekstop is easy as you don't have to look out for processing power constraints.

- In scrapping the data from the web and cleaning it for proper usage for the users. The data scraping was a challenge and deploying it on replit too, as this was my first time using replit and there are not a lot of resources to deploy django on replit.

- Making a all round fitness app that encompasses all the areas whether it be exercise, yoga or diet was a major challenge to do in 24 hours.
